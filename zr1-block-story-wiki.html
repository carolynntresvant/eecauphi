                            <p> If someone was just now buying into the game, how would they learn about the background. As they fall, Tythel lost her grip on Karjon’s back. She thought she’d be separated from him, spend her last moments alone, but his rear talon stretched out to catch her as they fell. She wrapped her good arm around it, holding onto the limb for all she was worth. At least we die together. Karjon, however, had other ideas. She couldn’t even begin to imagine what kind of pain he was in, but he still twisted his body as they fell until his mouth was facing the ground. She noticed I spend a LOT of time at Ulta and Sephora. I frequent Ulta a lot because I work in the cosmetics/beauty industry when I am not doing my wine work. Today, I wore a black dress and heels at work and my hair and makeup is always done. So after my shift I went to pick up some Morphe brushes, palettes, and new lip colors from Urban Decay. While shopping around, I speak to a few of the ladies that work there. They know me and often show me the new items that are available that they like. I am quite. And all guests were in-house. Not a snowflake was stirring, not even their spouse. The reg cards were placed in the bucket with care. In hopes that the pre-paids would soon be there. The travelers were nestled all snug in their beds, While visions of their own beds danced in their heads. And the cabbies in their uniform and I in mine, had settled in for a winters night grind. When out in the parking lot there arose such a clatter, I sprang from the office to see what was the matter. In the daytime, people are largely unconcerned with danger. They carry on with their individual lives and go their separate ways. It’s not that they are unaware of the lurking risks of life. Each of them just basks in the reassuring glow of the sun. It’s apparently human nature to relish in any false sense of illumination. They pretend that a glowing ball of fire in the sky provides a universal reprieve from peril. In the evenings as the sun fades, they turn on lamps to maintain a safe distance. 
So I just bought Pokken but wanted to see what the community thought was a good place to start playing! Thanks in advance. What'd be the best way to get my fill? Books? Tie-in comics? Respected wikis? Is there a tier system for canonicity. More specifically the sidebar rules that we've had since time immemorial. I've had half a mind to have them changed to be less overwhelming and more direct. So I'd like your input. Should the subreddit rules be changed? or stay the way they are? Some go, some stay? EDIT: Man, I missed a "Da Rules" joke.ah. This new wave of digital currency that has taken the internet by storm just turned into a tsunami. Leave it up to 4chan to think of the next big thing to go viral on the internet. They have done it countless times before. The only difference is that this time we are dealing with a 'store of value' which means the phrase 'going viral' just got taken to a whole new level. (Moon to precise. Wow) I put all my digital currency into Dogecoin, which may not be very much to some of you reading 
I love playing magic, and I've always been curious about the greater story of the game. I want learn more about the lore and the story. Does anyone know where I can get the general story? I would love to find synopses of the important books, or just a list of the best books to read. Thanks. So I love this game, its amazing, but I'm a relatively new player, starting just before battle for zendikar and only getting seriously into it around shadows of innistrad, I know there is a shit ton of story, but know very little about it and have no idea how to learn more easily. I'd rather not spend any money, but can if necessary, does anyone have any suggestions on how to get a good understanding of just what the hell is going on in this game? Cheers. Not entirely new to world building, but the project I'm now working on is the first that I've been the sole creator and have had little outside influence. What do you guys do when you can't decide I've been reading back through this archive but it goes back only to July 24, 2014. It references search in the archives which gets me articles as far back as 2002, but I don't know which keywords to use to get all the lore articles and results are flooded with generic discussions of cards and tournaments. Anyone knows how to filter that search to get the written fiction/lore only? Any other sources for that kind of MtG stuff. Hello r/gw2, veteran of MMOs, new to GW2, and I have a few questions (after perusing the wiki+sidebar). 1. how do I join sPVP matches? I went to HotM, I opened the queue, and I clicked "Join Now" under Hot Join. It popped me into a match as a spectator, and I couldn't find how to actually get my guy in there to fight. I ran across a blog that said I will see an instructions menu upon joining the match (to pick a side, or to choose to spectate). I recall seeing the screen the guy mentioned. 
Like every year, we're collecting all the April Fool's pranks that each subreddit is running. If you find one, post it here. edit please try to keep any top level comments on topic and about reddit's or any subreddit April 1st jokes (other website pranks also welcome) final edit I think I'm done. I tried to get all the responses into the body of this post. I apologize if I missed a few, but there were a lot. I'll still be updating the notable Sequence links until the sitewide event. Today is the day of the (for now) last vote on the EU Copyright Directive. If the parliament approves this proposal, it will become law. Link to the livestream of the debate: The articles passed:https://twitter.com/Senficon/status/1110509970213294081 # What is the EU Copyright Directive? The Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market 2016/0280(COD) is a proposed European Union directive with the stated goal to harmonise aspects. Hey all, J_Alexander_HS (https://www.twitch.tv/j_alexander_hs) back again today to look at the topic of nerfs. With the new Standard rotation, the meta has, without question, dramatically improved in terms of player experience. Nevertheless, people are talking about nerfs (because when aren't we?), specifically to the two top classes in the meta right now: Warrior and Rogue. Warrior is pretty straight-forward case in terms of the ire directed at it, and with good reason: 
Everyone who spends quality time on Amazon or other shopping sites knows they have a serious problem with fake reviews and fake products. Although I've been professionally reviewing products for 20 years, as I've dug deeper into the prepper world for The Prepared (https://theprepared.com/?utm_source=rdtprprsamputm_medium=forumamputm_campaign=19-05-fakes), I'm still shocked at just how widespread the problem is (even for relatively niche products). I'm working on a big prepper product. I've played RPGs and tabletop games since I was around 16, we would maybe play once a fortnight through the summer, mainly 3.5 or 5th ed, little seshes where we got to know the rules and clunked around dungeons with our premade characters. Then I came to university, and I got into RPGs hardcore. At my peak I was in 4 sessions a week, running 2 more, plus regular one shots/playing NPCs for friends, yes it completely wrecked me, but it was so much fun, pretty much all my friends were met throug. Shibe Park (https://i.pinimg.com/736x/54/ef/fd/54effd15ad4656706582c87a065d559b--color-shot-mlb-stadiums.jpg) in Philadelphia, later known as Connie Mack Stadium, opened on this date 110 years ago -- April 12, 1909. In addition to all the usual pomp and circumstance of opening day, there was tragedy -- a ballplayer who died after crashing into a wall while chasing a pop-up. Or did he? More about that later. A New Home for the Athletics The Philadelphia Athletics -- owned by Benjami. 
TL;DR: this is a list of things I wish I knew when I started amp#x200B; I'm sure many of the players that are just starting their journey in GW2 already have some experiences in other RPGs, be it table top, MMO or single player. Many of them share some similarities that are usually taken for granted, but here they are thrown out of the window. GW2 is sort of unconventional in how some of its systems work, so I'd like to compile a list of some of the things that may not be the way new players. </p>
